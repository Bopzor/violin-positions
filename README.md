# Violin positions

This app is meant to help violin players to lean the positions.  

It shows the four raw strings, with the violin notes, display according to semitones.

You can select from 0 to 7 positions to be shown on the strings, alongside fingers' position. (You can display fingers' position according to a specific string on root note click)

The notes can be written in English or French notation.
